**Words of advice:**

  - If you haven't coded a gradient descent from scratch before you should really try.
  - If you can, join the University of Washington's regression course reference above, it's really good. If you can't afford it, try "audit the course" button or apply for the financial aid to enroll
  - If you like phyiscal books, start with the reference books above, you don't really have to buy them if you're residing locally, the national library board (in Singapore) have most them. If not you can download the NLB app and recommend the librarians to get it. =)

**Words of advice:**

 - Best help on the framework you get would be the dev-users communication channels that are in place for the specific frameworks
   - [PyTorch] https://discuss.pytorch.org/
   - [Tensorflow/Keras] https://www.tensorflow.org/community/ (mainly stackoverflow, just tag your question with `tensorflow` tag)
   - [Fast AI] https://forums.fast.ai/ 
 - Knowing tensorboard will get you far, do take a look at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBbEDRsCmv4
 - The video/book tutorials in the references above are great start to the frameworks, investing time in them will save you time learning the way of the hard knocks later.

### 1.3: Deep Learning (for real)

Honestly, if you're only learning how to use frameworks and knowing which models/layers to use to specific tasks, it's cool and most probably you get something working. 

Knowing how to debug when training the model, how to evaluate models and how to improve the models has little to do with whether you know the syntax of the frameworks or stack the layers properly.

My suggestion is to go through the introduction courses listed in the reference list in 1.2 tediously. 
 
  - Don't just watch the videos and `shift`+`enter` through the notebooks
  - Do change some values in the notebooks and see how and understand why the function/layer/outputs reacts to the changes
  - Don't keep to yourself if you're stuck, go to the respective forums of the framework to look for help
  - Do be nice and descriptive when asking for help =)
  <!-- - Don't pass go, don't collect $200 (Just joking on this point; pardon the bad Monopoly game pun) -->
  
If you want a real deep dive to "Deep Learning (for real)", many good universities have their course materials freely available, there's no need to really pay someone to regurgitate them to you ;p
