### 3.4: **Natural Language Processing (*for real*) **

Natural Language Processing evolves really fast and as a field that mostly adopts/applies the "hottest" trend from mainstream machine/deep learning, every ~2-3 years the underlying state-of-art architecture for NLP changes (quite drastically). 

The only way to keep up is not to chase the trends. Know that the lastest/hottest algorithm or pre-trained models exists, understand how they work and find ways to incorporate them into whichever project/method you're using/researching on. 

There's really no point in chasing any method (in NLP or any other sub-fields of computing) because 

 - if you're in the industry, what usually happens is that you try every possible method until you find  that fits your needs
 - if you're in academia, chasing state-of-art is going to drain you out and make your work mediorce/common, focus on the story and why things work more than how to make model X work on task Y.
   
In 2018, here's some recent trends: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.02709.pdf
